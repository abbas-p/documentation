npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

npm consists of three distinct components:

*  the website
*  the Command Line Interface (CLI)
*  the registry

Use the [*website*](https://npmjs.com) to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up [organizations](https://www.npmjs.com/features) to manage access to public or private packages.

The [*CLI*](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.

The [*registry*](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry) is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.
